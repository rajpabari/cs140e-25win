The fun part of baremetal is doing devices, so that's what all these
extensions are.  They are roughly ordered in increasing difficulty.

Just doing a few will give a good sense of options for a final project.
If you do them all, you should have a pretty cool set of building blocks
to do all sorts of interesting things.

  - `1-sonar`: measure distance with sonar.  These are cheap devices,
    and can be used for proximity sensing, changes in distance, etc.

    In theory you can use several to locate objects more precisely.
