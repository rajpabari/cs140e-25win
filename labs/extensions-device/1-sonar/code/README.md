TODO:
  1. Implement the code in hc-sr04.c and get rid of the calls to `staff_*`.
  2. Remove all dependency on staff code by commenting out `STAFF_OBJS` 
     in the `Makefile`.
  3. Make sure that the distances that get spit out make sense.  Also that
     your code handles the case that no signal is reflected back.

Nothing depends on this lab, so feel free to rename things however
you want!
