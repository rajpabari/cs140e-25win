### Initial hardware we will use.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We're going to add some devices later (sonar, and RF transceivers)
but this is the initial list of hardware you'll need.  You should order
these ASAP so that they are here well before the new class.  If it's an
issue to pay for this, email me (engler) and I'll paypal you a supplement.

In general: 

  1.  Hardware can arrive broken, or it can become broken, either
  "just because" or because you plug things together wrong (ask me
  how I know!).  Also, hardware is a noun, and nouns are easy to lose.
  So for the following, always order *at least* two of everything (two
  pi's, two usb adaptors, two microSD cards).  Additionally, you'll need
  two working pi's for the networking labs.

  2. Pay attention to ship dates so that it will arrive in time.  It's
  very easy to miss that some sellers ship from China.

  3. If you already have the pieces you need, you are more than welcome
  to just use that (e.g., from cs107e), with the caveat that you need to have
  two of everything.


What you need:

  0. A laptop that runs Linux or MacOS.  Windows has a a variety of
     tedious issues which we won't be able to help you with, especially
     since the class is online (this is true even if you use WSL).

     In the past, some die-hard Windows users have made it about half
     way through the quarter before giving up and converting to a Linux
     dual-boot system, so doing that before the quarter starts will
     save you time :).

  1. At least two r/pi model 1 A+'s.  (Do not order: model 2, model 3, model 4
     or model B+)

     R/pi A+ ($20) from [Newark](https://www.newark.com/raspberry-pi/raspbrry-moda-512m/silicon-manufacturer-broadcom/dp/81Y5333).

     R/pi Zero W also works ($14); they're smaller and cheaper.
     But some places might not allow you to order two.  
     [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15470) appears to have some 
     Zero W's in stock.  (You should also order a R/pi A+ as well.)

     The Zero (without a W) should be fine too, just make sure it comes with 
     headers pre-soldered.

  2. A bag of big 10MM LEDs so we don't need resistors or a breadboard.

     [These seem reasonable](https://www.amazon.com/Gikfun-Emitting-Diodes-Diffused-Arduino/dp/B06XWTN1YM/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=10mm+LED&qid=1616195942&refinements=p_85%3A2470955011&rnid=2470954011&rps=1&sr=8-4).

  3. At least two USB to TTL adaptors so you can communicate from your
     laptop to the pi.

     [These have worked in the
     past](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CWKHTLH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

     [These too](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D6LLX19/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

    Note: If you order from other places, look for adaptors which use the CP2102 
    chipset.  Other chips may work, but we haven't tested them.

  4. You'll also need a set of jumpers in order to connect your pi to stuff:

     [These seem reasonable](https://www.amazon.com/SIM-NAT-Breadboard-Arduino-Raspberry/dp/B07RX78T9L/ref=sr_1_11?dchild=1&keywords=female+to+female+jumper&qid=1616196142&refinements=p_85%3A2470955011%2Cp_72%3A1248879011&rnid=1248877011&rps=1&s=electronics&sr=1-11)

     [These worked for Akshay](https://www.amazon.com/EDGELEC-Breadboard-Optional-Assorted-Multicolored/dp/B07GD2BWPY/)

     Note: if you order from other places, make sure you get 
     "female-to-female" jumpers.

  5. Depending on your laptop you might need a USB-C to USB-A adaptor,
     and/or an adaptor for microSD cards so that you can connect the
     USB-TTL device above and format microSD cards.  (Note: You will
     almost certainly need both types of adaptors if you have a Mac.)

     [All-in-one adaptor that worked in the past](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NW8RPYN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

     [USB-C to USB-A](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CVX3516/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

     Note: Some people try to use a USB hub, with multiple connectors.
     That has often led to problems, so I'd personally recommend a
     dedicated adaptor.

  6. Two or more small (8-32GB) microSD card from a reputable manufacturer.
     We've had some issues with off-brand cards, but SanDisk seems to work.

     [This card seems reasonable](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk%C2%AE-microSDHCTM-8GB-Memory-Card/dp/B0012Y2LLE/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=microsd&qid=1616198363&refinements=p_n_feature_two_browse-bin%3A6518302011%7C6518303011&rnid=6518301011&s=pc&sr=1-6)
