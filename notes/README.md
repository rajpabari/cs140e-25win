Notes on key concepts for the quarter.  Unfortunately contain 
both omissions and repetitions.  Anything discussed will usually
be needed for a lab:

 - Makefiles: [makefiles](makefiles/README.md)
 - Observability and compiler optimization: 
   [observability](observability/README.md)
 - Devices: [how to reason about devices](devices/DEVICES.md); 
   [gpio](devices/GPIO.md), [miniUART](devices/miniUART.md).
 - Registers: [caller/callee](caller-callee/README.md)
 - [How to use the compiler to figure out assembly code](using-gcc-for-asm/README.md)

 - Interrupts: [armv6 interrupt cheatsheet](interrupts/INTERRUPT-CHEAT-SHEET.md)
   [armv6 mode bug examples](mode-bugs/README.md)
 - [armv6 debug hardware cheatsheet](debug-hw/DEBUG-cheat-sheet.md)
